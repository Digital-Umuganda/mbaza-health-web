performed by 2 different people, we have linguists who evaluate and rate the words and sentences that are
generated by the system, especially regarding their correctness, we have also professional health workers, who are
the ones who deal with the correctness of the response generated by the system, last but not least we have
administrators, their role is to have an overview of everything going on in the project, starting from the
translation review, response review, and users without forgetting the ability power to make changes to the users.
